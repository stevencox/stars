# stars

This is a prototype Python API for working with a Stars cluster.

It encapsulates the entire system in terms of the following key abstractions:
* Automation: Execute DevOps tools via Ansible.
* Configuration: View and manipulate Zookeeper configuration.
* Services: Manage long running services in Marathon.
* Scheduler: Manage scheduled, potentially hierarchical tasks.
